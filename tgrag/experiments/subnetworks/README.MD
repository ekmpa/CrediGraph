# Subnetwork analysis

Attempting to discern the structural & temporal characteristics of credible v. non-credible subnetworks in our data.

- Goal: analyse non-credible and credible subnets across months, monitor their features
  - Ideally, also looking at other signlas (mbfc, semi-supervised signals)
  - Currently 2-hop, could we go further? Is there any incentive to?

> **Ego Nets:** from [the literature](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2392622.2392624), an ego network is a social network formed of an individual (ego) and the people with whom ego is in contact (alters).
