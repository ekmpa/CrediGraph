## PageRank:

The PageRank implementation includes four validation tests:

1. **Convergence Test**: Verifies the algorithm converged within the maximum iterations
1. **Score Sum Test**: Ensures all PageRank scores sum to 1.0 (probability conservation)
1. **Positive Values Test**: Confirms all scores are positive (> 0)
1. **Degree Correlation Test**: Validates relationship between node connectivity and PageRank scores

All tests mus pass for reliable results.
