# TGRAG

Data analysis for TG/RAG project @ CDL

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage and lock project dependencies for a consistent and reproducible environment. If you do not have `uv` installed on your system, visit [this page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for installation instructions.

**Note**: to get `uv`, run:

```sh
pip install uv
# or
brew install uv
```

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repo
git@github.com:ekmpa/CrediGraph.git

# Enter the repo directory
cd CrediGraph

# Install core dependencies into an isolated environment
uv sync

# The isolated env is .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# If you have your environment and want to sync that instead, run
uv sync --active
```

## Usage
